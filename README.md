## Description
We were tasked to write a program that will convert a temperature from fahrenheit to celsius, or from celsius to fahrenheit. This was an exercise in Javascript, not CSS.

## How to Run
1. Clone repo to your local computer
2. In your terminal be sure you are in this downloaded directory
3. Once you are in the correct directory run this:

  ```
  http-server -p 9999
  ```

4. Then navigate to http://localhost:9999 in your browser (preferably Google Chrome)
5. Go ahead and enter in temperatures and click "convert"
